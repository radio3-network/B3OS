B3 Operating System

A long awaited GUI and CLI operating system
for ESP32 devices.


You would likely use this OS because:

    + creates standard dialogs (e.g. select wifi network)
    + easy to use button/textarea, icons
    + keyboard on screen is automatically handled


Creating apps should be easy and don't require
compiling firmwares. In smartphones we just install
apps and the same should be available for ESP32.

The Blümchen GUI is a set of LVGL-based methods
for creating graphical dialogs without trouble.

There is an example on the setup() method to help you
getting started with the syntax.


You would likely use this library because:

    + creates standard dialogs (e.g. select wifi network)
    + easy to use button/textarea, icons
    + keyboard on screen is automatically handled
